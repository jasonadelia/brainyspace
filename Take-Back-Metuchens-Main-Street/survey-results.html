      <h1>What other ideas do you have that could improve downtown Metuchen?</h1>
      <blockquote>BID</blockquote>
      <blockquote>I would like to see more public art.  I was recently in nyack, ny and even the garbage cans were coolly painted.  I would also like to see more out door seating to encourage people to be out of their carsand walking aroundtown with plenty of places to sit andchat our rest...</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Have current shops keep area clean around the stores</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Music store, but not a chain or a dumpy thing. A place people can get quality instruments and gear without paying through the nose, staffed by people who know their stuff.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>I think more things for kids and families would Draw people downtown. Something like a creative space/gallery where kids can come and create and gather and hang out, especially young teens.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Trader Joes</blockquote>
      <blockquote>We need someone to market and promote Metuchen and all our businesses. We need outreach and recruitment to the stores and businesses we want to see in Metuchen.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Additions to and/or enforcement of the Borough's code to make life more unpleasant for landlords that do not actively try to fill their stores.  Offer incentives to filling the space and keeping it filled- tax breaks for tenants, not vacancies. This should be the borough's priority.</p>
        <p>Hire An Economic Development Advisor like other towns do- Highland Park and Westfield.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>No kids store on the second floor. Who can stop in w a baby in a stroller?</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Stricter enforcement of traffic--I see a lot of people running amber lights at high speed and tearing down the streets. </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Improved sidewalks and bike lanes so that we can safely get to our local resources without always having to get in the car. </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Mulit-use space: Vegetable market by day, restaurant serviing regional fresh food by night</p>
        <p>Music-Restuarant/music venue where you buy a ticket to a show and have a food purchase minimum</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Definitely NOT an ice cream place, a restaurant, or a coffee place</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1. More diversified dining (greek, new american, etc.)</p>
        <p>2. Art Co-Op</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>More street=wde business development plans, such as Metuchen Cash Mob where the business' deals bring more people downtown on a particular day.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>the old foodtown lot finished after over 10 years of nothingness.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Opening up the down town area to upscale fast food chains (chipotle, salad place, etc.)</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Improve public parking.  As well possibly opening Main Street to franchises.  Businesses should be more high end as in Westfield & Summit.  </blockquote>
      <blockquote>More people working downtown would drive demand for businesses to meet their needs.  Was there ever any consideration of creating class "A" office space in connection with the parking structure?  Something that would attract a large regional accounting firm or law office?</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Higher end stores and a hotel in downtown metuchen would really be great. It would really make main street stores more money. Healthy eateries would also be great since there is not many places at all like that. We have enough pizzerias around. We need something different.  </blockquote>
      <blockquote>No more nail salons</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Its not the type of business we have or had .... We have lost countless numbers of a variety of businesses over the years and the reason is the same everytime .. the rent was too high.  it is to my understanding that there is a significant tax break for building owners that have empty leased space and therefore there is absolutely no incentive for any owner (McPhearson for one) to lease empty space.  I'm sure there are other factors to also be considered this just happens to be the one I am familiar with but this question still applies ....Why is is that no one addresses the root of the problem and continually tries to "band-aid" it by bringing in new business?  Bottom line is .. they arent staying because rent is too high (regardless of what type of business it is) ... how do we fix that???  Einstein's definition of insanity "Doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results"  Sound familiar???</blockquote>
      <blockquote>angled in parking (like greenwich ct), turn lanes or light at main and hillside, penalty for landlords who keep spaces unrented</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Drop in Recreational facility</p>
        <p>Dog park</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Enough pizzerias.  Get a McDonalds, Burger King, Applebees, Ruby Tuesdays or TGI Fridays in town and you'll attract A LOT of business to the downtown area.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Get stores in the already open spaces before building new stuff</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Signs showing newcomers where to park, more parking, free parking incentives, better looking store fronts. </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Not so many people? That was meant tongue in cheek but I live on Hillside and last night at about 6:20 I was stuck for 4 cycles of the traffic light before I could turn left on Main St. The traffic is just awful. </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Limit truck traffic/solve the train overpass issues. Jail time for developers that abandon projects in favor of tax breaks. Is there a greater eyesore in Metuchen than the empty buildings next to Friendly's???</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Allow a chain store, ie gap, etc to open up. </blockquote>
      <blockquote>More street festivals such as Junebug, perhaps a cyclovia like they have in new brunswick, that will all help in promoting local businesses.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Teen friendly eating establishment.  Fast food is okay if decorated properly </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Develop A-grade office space in the Pearl St lot.  This would bring a large employer in to the town, along with substantial daytime population to support our Main Street shops and restaraunts.  We can not expect themt o survive, much less flourish, and an entirely residential clientele.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>I don't know what to call this--I'm sure it's a job that exists or that there's a name for it-- but the Boro administrators need to do something about the way traffic flows through town.  There aren't enough options for just turning around to get to available parking. If you get to the end of Main Street and saw a spot on the other side, you have to make an elaborate U turn (into the train station on Woodbridge, behind Jerry's building with the Do Not Enter/No Parking sign just before the train tracks) or behind the Buttery Bakery where the dance school has decided no one else is allowed to drive/park... We can't turn off Main Street into the lot behind Antonios anymore.  Never mind the traffic that can make travelling through Metuchen a 20-minute event, never mind the no left-turn signs all over town. And forget about the imminent threat of a flood of additional vehicles from the parking deck. There's a problem maneuvering on Main Street and it makes Main Street less accessible for motorists who might want to shop locally.  Is this called urban planning? Civil engineering?  We need help with traffic flow and planning.  Adding more decorative "brick" cross walks and flower-bed medians might help slow traffic, but we need to make Main Street accessible. </blockquote>
      <blockquote>A small hotel like a Holiday Inn Express.  It would provide jobs, perhaps have a restaurant, and a ballroom so we could have school fundraisers in town.  It is tough to have family in from out of town for holidays or religious observances.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>The small grocer shop can also contain a fish \ meat counter, and fresh produce.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>When I was working in Manhattan 10+ years ago, I always felt the merchants should be open for commuters to grab something for dinner when they get off the train.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>MORE PARKING. I end up foregoing errands on Main 
      Street when I can't find parking. I would like to see fewer salons and more restaurants and cafes. Brass Lantern needs to take their off-putting sign discouraging young children, out of ther window,</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Free or 1hr free parking on main for shoppers.  Better lighting on sidewalks and streets. A uniform code for store signage and awnings.  Keeping the areas in front of each store clean and presentable.
      Having a Metuchen only flyer for the stores.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>we need a supermarket in Metuchen.......very badly!!</blockquote>
      <blockquote>a retail supermarket</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Some sort of community loyalty card that encouraged residents and visitors to shop locally through townwide special discount days (think restaurant week, small business Saturday, etc)</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Please see the message I just sent you a few minutes ago about the trash problem on Main Street!</blockquote>
      <blockquote>We went to find a coffee shop after dinner and there is none!  The one I knew of isn't open at night.  Was quite bummed.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Whole foods store</p>
        <p>Trader Joe's</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Too many items sticking up from the sidewalk: trash barrels, recycling containers, parking meters, light posts, sign posts, trees. Do other towns have creative ways of making all that stuff look better and take up less space? </blockquote>
      <blockquote>A fun place for Tweens/teens to spend time, ceramic studio, make your own jewelry studio</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Supermarket!!</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>- TRADER JOES!!!!!</p>
        <p>- Mexican restaurant/taqueria would be great!</p>
        <p>- Wine bar where NJ Tavern was</p>
        <p>- Can we somehow encourage shops to stop taping ugly paper signs in their windows???</p>
        <p>- I wish the existing shops would take pride and ownership. ""Buttery Bakeshop"" has had a broken ""R"" for years now and looks like ""BUTTEPY."" Why is that okay!?</p>
        <p>- PLEASE NO MORE HAIR SALONS, NAIL SALONS, and PIZZA SHOPS-- we have too many!!!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Encourage unique restaurant ideas. We currently have 3 Italian themed restaurants, multiple pizzerias, and 4 Asian restaurants. Mexican or steak would be a great alternative </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Enforce existing traffic laws</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Trader Joes would be great. </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Finish and rent the property next to Friendly's.  Enforce upkeep of Main St businesses.  I guess it's all about rents???</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Pedestrian friendly and better parking. I avoid downtown on weeknights, the traffic is bad, crossing streets is hazardous. It is not welcoming.</p>
        <p>Some stores need to be cleaned up both in and out.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Encourage property owners to renovate or spruce up their properties--some of the older buildings (80+ years) look good and are aesthetically pleasing; the younger ones (housing, for example, Deli Delight, Antonio's are simply godawful.  The newest addition (used to be the Jewelry store, now the high-end kitschshop) is nice.  So, renovate and make the storefronts more inviting.  Encourage the owners to build above the storefronts (in places where there is no second floor yet).</blockquote>
      <blockquote>allow additional restaurants to sell alcohol/wine with dinner.need some type of music/entertainment venue to walk to after a nice dinner. </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Analyze what makes downtowns successful in towns where those areas are thriving and use that as a model; no need to reinvent the wheel! </blockquote>
      <blockquote>I think that a Trader Joes or similar independent store could be a good draw for the town.  Come for the Trader Joes, stay for the other shops.  Grocery shopping is one thing I don't do online, but many other types of shopping are more convenient to do online.  Parking is also an issue.  I drive down Main St. every day on my way to and from work, but I have two kids under 5 years old, so it's a pain to think about parking on Main St, and unloading them from the car by myself.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>more places to sit outdoors</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Steak house!!!  And a really good Mexican!  </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Most of the items I checked are stores we already had in Metuchen, all of which closed over the years, some after long tenure and some after a brief life.</p>
        <p>I wonder if we couldn't develop some sort of subscription idea to support local stores, a take off on a CSA membership where we either pay in advance, or commit to spending a specific amount over a year, either in one store or a cluster of stores. We were big supporters of To Be Continued and it still shocks me that this town could not support the store adequately. I kept thinking that maybe if we had all committed to buying a certain amount equivalent to our normal book purchasing and favored TBC over Barnes and Noble or Amazon, they'd still be here. We also have to educate citizens that it's sometimes worth paying a little more to keep businesses in the town.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Public art, safer pedestrian conditions, REWARDS - like a Metuchen Bonus card you swipe/stamp at local establishments...  I know a ton of people, businesses, and non-profits would donate towards it.  Not a discount, but you rack up points for dollars spent downtown, and each point is a chance in a monthly drawing for these prizes.  It sounds ungainly at first, but I've seen it down elsewhere and it really works.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Ticket shop owners that use the meters in front of their stores.</p>
        <p>Ticket drivers who speed.</p>
        <p>Ticket drivers who do not obey pedestrians crossing where they should, in the crosswalk.</p>
        <p>Did I mention a food co-op!? It would be so amazing to get staples like beans, flours and pantry items right here in town.  Fresh food would be amazing, too!</p>
        <p>A Chelsea-market type place would never fly in Metuchen.  Parking sucks, who is going to drive to town to get a boatload of awesome eats to only have to trudge it to their car that's blocks and blocks away. I mean, look at Westfield's parking situation and Trader Joe's - it's HORRIFIC.</p>
        <p>I think the town should do away with charging for parking at the train stations and open it up to those that want to shop, dine and walk around main street.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>By Art Shop do you mean finished Art, or Art supplies?  If Art supplies - yes.</p>
        <p>I'd stay away from anything upscale or high-end.  People in town go to Costco and Target.  We already have enough high priced restaurants.</p>
        <p>The existing landlords/merchants could make their places look better, and fix the sidewalks, but they're struggling.  At the same time, I don't think taxpayers should pay for that.  They could also stop taking the best parking for themselves.</p>
        <p>We also need places for middle schoolers and teenagers to hang out - though those places don't generally make enough money.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>THERE IS NO ORDINANCE PROHIBITING CHAIN STORES.  ONLY "FAST FOOD" IS PROHIBITED.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Can we please get the Buttery Bake Shop to fix the R in its sign? It's been like that for at least 7 years. Even with a grand reopening they didn't fix the sign. It looks like crap.</p>
        <p>Also, fix up the storefront signage and building fronts on a bunch of the buildings. Some of them look like dumps (the building with the convenience store, Antonio's area, for example.</p>
        <p>Fix the busted up Main Street sidewalks.</p>
        <p>Paint the rail bridge.</p>
        <p>Put up gigantic signs before the bridge that will absolutely grab the attention of moronic truck drivers BEFORE they slam into the bridge.</p>
        <p>Improve crossing lights at Highland.</p>
        <p>Stop allowing obscure businesses that don't make any sense to open on Main Street (is it legal to do this? Not sure, but a cartridge replacement store, honestly?)</p>
        <p>Stop allowing beauty salons and nail salons to keep opening.</p>
        <p>Need more kid friendly venues. Preschool of Rock at the schoolhouse was a huge draw. Almost too many people. As if to say, if there were other options, we would be all over those - a lot.</p>
        <p>Need better, healthy/fresh eat-in/takeout food options (not wait service).</p>
        <p>Would love a renovated Dick's Dock to make a comeback.</p>
        <p>While Junebug and Car Cruise Nights are great draws and great ideas for community building, I find them to be very dangerous for pedestrians and bicyclists. Especially Junebug. On a Friday night at rush hour drivers are hurrying to get home and not paying attention, while throngs of pedestrians line the Main Street sidewalks (some darting across intersections or jaywalking). It's just a bad mix. Events in the New Street lot or on Main Street when the road is closed feel much safer.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>If Main Street does get better businesses - especially something with major appeal like Trader Joe's - we have to realize that there will be an ""if you build it, they will come mindset."" ""They"" would not include just locals but also those within a radius shorter than that to another Trader Joe's. In other words, vehicular traffic. Big time. The borough needs to consider better parking, wider roads (27) if considering businesses that will draw people.</p>
        <p>Get rid of sidewalk trash cans. Gross.</p>
        <p>Improve train station. Feels unwelcoming.</p>
        <p>Open two more Frescos.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Property tax credits for owners to make certain capital improvements - exterior refinishing, signage, awnings, accessibility.</p>
        <p>Visible parking lot signs.  Do we have a free lot?  Pearl is free on weekends thanks to chamber. Signs to free 24/7 parking if it exists would be useful.</p> 
        <p>If we only had a _____ store isn't going to fix anything but it's nice to daydream. Some of these stores would be nice but stores come and go, and are successful based on market conditions, owner ability and funding, many other variables.  Success of Metuchen's downtown will depend on larger changes - from the borough and it's residents.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>I'd still like to have a good book store in town.  It was one of the requirements we had for moving here.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Can't the town do anything to make landlords refresh the buildings - some are woefully sad looking. Mall stores have to sign contracts to refresh the look of the store exterior every "X" amount of years - it keeps things looking sharp.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Have someone clear the snow from empty storefronts and crosswalks when it snows.  I don't drive and can walk to Main St. but could not shop at some stores this winter because it was too icy and dangerous for a senior citizen to navigate further down the block or across the street.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>We really need a grocery store. I think it will help bring in tax revenue which now goes to Edison or sometimes even to Woodbridge or Westfield for higher end groceries. </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Creating a downtown improvement district.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Improved bike infrastructure. Cyclists bring business!</blockquote>
      <blockquote>I'd like to see a rewards program like the one  in Highland Park (discussed on your FB page) for property tax credit or cash back for renters and out-of-towners. Sound like a good incentive to shop downtown.</blockquote>
